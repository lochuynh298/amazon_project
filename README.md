## üìå Background & Overview  

### Objective:
### üìñ What is this project about? 

I have worked on analyzing a dataset of over 20,000 sales records from an Amazon-like e-commerce platform. This project involves extensive querying of customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends using PostgreSQL. Through this project, I have tackled various SQL problems, including revenue analysis, customer segmentation, and inventory management.

The project also focuses on data cleaning, handling null values, and solving real-world business problems using structured queries.
### üë§ Who is this project for? 

‚û°Ô∏è **Marketing Manager** who want to understand the customer segmentation. 

###  ‚ùìBusiness Questions:  

1.How can we analyze customer behavior, sales trends, and traffic performance to develop an effective new marketing strategy?
2. Low product availability due to inconsistent restocking.
3. High return rates for specific product categories.
4. Significant delays in shipments and inconsistencies in delivery times.
5 High customer acquisition costs with a low customer retention rate.


### üéØProject Outcome:  

- **Key Insights**: Analysis reveals monthly trends, high traffic from Amazon all highlighting user engagement and behavior. Idenity the reason shippment late, Customer Life Time , AOV
- **Strategic Focus**: These findings emphasize the importance of data-driven strategies to enhance customer engagement, optimize eCommerce operations, and drive revenue growth.

## üß† Problem Solving Process

|-|-|-|-
| Which to be calculated (sum, count, ratio, etc.) and grouped? <br> Does it needs any filter (time, conditions, etc.)? | Which tables have data that I want to get? <br> Which columns have data corresponded to the problem? <br> Can I get the data I by one step, if not, break down even smaller? | How many step did I need to get the final result? <br> Is it optimized? | _We'll go through this step in the order of each query listed below_ <br> ‚¨áÔ∏è

## **Task: Data Cleaning**

I cleaned the dataset by:
- **Removing duplicates**: Duplicates in the customer and order tables were identified and removed.
- **Handling missing values**: Null values in critical fields (e.g., customer address, payment status) were either filled with default values or handled using appropriate methods.

---

## **Handling Null Values**

Null values were handled based on their context:
- **Customer addresses**: Missing addresses were assigned default placeholder values.
- **Payment statuses**: Orders with null payment statuses were categorized as ‚ÄúPending.‚Äù
- **Shipping information**: Null return dates were left as is, as not all shipments are returned.

---

## **Solving Business Problems**

### Solutions Implemented:
#### Query 1Ô∏è‚É£: Query the top 10 products by total sales value / Include product name, total quantity sold, and total sales value.


```sql
SELECT 
	oi.product_id,
	p.product_name,
	SUM(oi.total_sale) as total_sale,
	COUNT(o.order_id)  as total_orders
FROM orders as o
JOIN
order_items as oi
ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
JOIN 
products as p
ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 10
```

üí° Apple's iMac 24-inch and iMac 27-inch Retina sell the most units. However, the Apple iMac Pro generates the highest revenue, suggesting it has a much higher price. Apple products, in general, seem to be strong performers. 

#### Query 2Ô∏è‚É£: Revenue by Category Calculate total revenue generated by each product category. / Challenge: Include the percentage contribution of each category to total revenue.


```sql
SELECT 
	p.category_id,
	c.category_name,
	SUM(oi.total_sale) as total_sale,
	SUM(oi.total_sale)/
					(SELECT SUM(total_sale) FROM order_items) 
					* 100
	as contribution
FROM order_items as oi
JOIN
products as p
ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
LEFT JOIN category as c
ON c.category_id = p.category_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC
```

üí° The primary insight is the massive revenue contribution from the electronics category, dwarfing all other categories. This highlights the current business focus and potential areas for strategic consideration regarding diversification and resource allocation.

#### Query 3Ô∏è‚É£:  Average Order Value (AOV) Compute the average order value for each customer./Include only customers with more than 5 orders.



```sql
SELECT 
	c.customer_id,
	CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ',  c.last_name) as full_name,
	SUM(total_sale)/COUNT(o.order_id) as AOV,
	COUNT(o.order_id) as total_orders --- filter
FROM orders as o
JOIN 
customers as c
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN 
order_items as oi
ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
HAVING  COUNT(o.order_id) > 5
```

üí° Focusing on customers with more than 5 orders reveals a range of spending behaviors. While some frequent customers consistently make high-value purchases, others place many lower-value orders. Understanding these nuances can help tailor marketing efforts and optimize customer retention strategies.

#### Query 4Ô∏è‚É£:  Monthly Sales Trend Query monthly total sales over the past year. / Challenge: Display the sales trend, grouping by month, return current_month sale, last month sale!


```sql
SELECT 
	year,
	month,
	total_sale as current_month_sale,
	LAG(total_sale, 1) OVER(ORDER BY year, month) as last_month_sale
FROM ---
(
SELECT 
	EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o.order_date) as month,
	EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.order_date) as year,
	ROUND(
			SUM(oi.total_sale::numeric)
			,2) as total_sale
FROM orders as o
JOIN
order_items as oi
ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
WHERE o.order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year'
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY year, month
) as t1
```

üí° The data highlights significant volatility in monthly sales, with a particularly concerning drop in the most recent month (March 2025). Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers behind these fluctuations and to identify any underlying trends or seasonality.

#### Query 5Ô∏è‚É£: Customers with No Purchases Find customers who have registered but never placed an order. / Challenge: List customer details and the time since their registration.



```sql
Approach 1
SELECT *
	-- reg_date - CURRENT_DATE
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id NOT IN (SELECT 
					DISTINCT customer_id
				FROM orders
				);
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5c882be-f95c-4ec7-a2a0-e78543f4b595)

üí° Develop a strategy to regain customer attention by calling them or sending an email to understand the reasons why they've become disengaged.

#### Query 6Ô∏è‚É£:6. Least-Selling Categories by State Identify the least-selling product category for each state. / Challenge: Include the total sales for that category within each state.

```sql
WITH ranking_table
AS
(
SELECT 
	c.state,
	cat.category_name,
	SUM(oi.total_sale) as total_sale,
	RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY c.state ORDER BY SUM(oi.total_sale) ASC) as rank
FROM orders as o
JOIN 
customers as c
ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN
order_items as oi
ON o.order_id = oi. order_id
JOIN 
products as p
ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN
category as cat
ON cat.category_id = p.category_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
)
SELECT 
*
FROM ranking_table
WHERE rank = 1
```
